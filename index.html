      <p>I live my life by the motto: "Stagnation is death". If you're not growing and becoming better then what's the point? This is one of the reasons I was drawn to a career in coding. Development is an ever evolving field and in order to keep up you are constantly learning new things. I also love solving problems, it lead me into the Customer Service roles that I have worked previously. There is no better feeling than solving a problem that you have been working on. The rush when a component works exactly as intended is riveting. When I'm not geeking out on projects I'm working on I can be found in nature either relaxing in my hammock or hiking with my dog.</p>
